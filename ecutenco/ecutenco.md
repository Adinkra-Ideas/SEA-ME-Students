## About me: 
- I am new in IT. Nevertheless, I have already graduated successfully from 
a few IT schools: Prometheus, Genius.Space School and Coursera. Therefore: 
●	I can write check lists, test cases, bug reports, test plans and test strategies; 
●	I know testing technics;
●	I know how to use testing instruments including Jira, DevTools, Postman, SoapUI; testing simulators (XCode, Android Studio) and emulators (Samsung Test Lab, Firebase Test Lab, AWS Device Farm); mobile apps testing (TestFlight, AppTester); sniffers (Fiddler, Charles); database MySQL; Git and GitHub; Excel reports and Google sheets.  
Besides that, I am very motivated to learn new instruments and programs and I know exactly how to learn quickly and effectively, because I have been working as a teacher already 12 years. I am self-confident, hard-working, organised, meticulous, highly motivated and enthusiastic worker full 
of fresh ideas, energy, creativity and positive thinking.
I speak five languages. 
And I have extensive experience in the fields, connected to management and communication with people. I feel them and always find the way to speak the same language with other people. I believe, that any situation or problem is possible to resolve and always find the way how to fix it out.
